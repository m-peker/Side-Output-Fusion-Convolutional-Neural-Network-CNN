# Side-Output-Fusion-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN
The deep learning architecture, called Side Output Fusion Network, classifies the feature map obtained by combining low-level, mid-level and high-level information from each convolution layer. Feature fusion from low and high level layers positively affects the results.
